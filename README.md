ðŸš— Toyota Corolla 3D Projection
This project creates a 3D-to-2D perspective projection of a Toyota Corolla using Python. It applies matrix transformations, rotations, and scaling to simulate realistic visual output, helping visualize how 3D objects are represented on 2D screens.

The project demonstrates how to transform and project 3D object coordinates onto a 2D plane using linear algebra techniques. By combining Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project renders a simplified wireframe of a Toyota Corolla, making it a practical example of computer graphics and matrix operations.

Features: 
3D-to-2D perspective projection
Matrix transformations: translation, scaling, rotation
Visualization of projected 3D model using Matplotlib
